The idea of this project is to teach kids programming using raspberry pi (maybe beaglebone or similar generic purpose board later) and GPIO. Our goal is to have everything running on the PI so you don't need anything but the PI, a keyboard and a monitor to start. So we keep it as cheap as possible for schools to be able to afford a simple setup if they want to.

## Why GPIO?

So the kids can actually see that if I do this something happened in real world light a servo motor starts spinning or a led light turns on. We can even have a prepared setup in a nice package of a robot, car, or anything like that ready to connect to the GPIO right away.
 
## How?

We want to have a workflow like engine running in node.js this workflow would represent the programming language. A single task in the workflow would look work something like this. Setup a GPIO pin with this number to output and write this value into it. We want to have logic gates as tasks as well as loops etc.

On top of this workflow we should have a "kid friendly" UI that would generate the workflow diagram as a JSON file. Think of this as a simplified BPM modeling tool.
